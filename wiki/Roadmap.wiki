#summary Temporary page for the project's roadmap

=Roadmap for 1.4.5=

==Bugs:==
  * "~~Stay mounted" does not work (http://pg.savorydeviate.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=4012&p=26228#p26246)~~
  * ~~Does not detect when battlegrounds end  (http://pg.savorydeviate.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=4012&start=60#p26662)~~
  * Does not ignore gathering nodes that it cannot reach/gather (http://pg.savorydeviate.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=4012&start=70#p26757)
  * Fixing issue where PG stops engaging enemies after a while. It'll run right into mobs as if they weren't there and then start attacking them, all surprised it got "ambushed". (http://pg.savorydeviate.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=4012&start=70#p26751)
  * Fishing issue with bobber either never being detected (infinite casting) or not always being detected (http://pg.savorydeviate.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=4012&hilit=fishing&start=40#p26457)
  * Fixing offset signatures broken in 3.3.3/3.3.3a

==Features:==
  * ~~Working PVP tab with functional random battlegrounds (either user selected or using the WoW lvl 80 feature)~~
  * Sparkle upgrading system
